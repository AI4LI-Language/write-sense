# Write Sense Introduction
Write Sense is an app that assists visually impaired users in writing and note-taking through voice recognition technology. With fast and accurate speech-to-text conversion, it enables users to create content effortlessly without needing to look at the screen. Additionally, Write Sense is a valuable tool for anyone who wants a hands-free writing experience, quick note-taking, or voice-based content creation.
# How to install
Weâ€™ve kept the demo as straightforward as possible by building a simple web app that streams audio via sockets to our backend for processing. The backend converts the incoming audio into text and sends it back to the frontend, and it also supports text-to-speech, returning audio signals that the frontend plays aloud.

First, make sure you have Python and pip installed on your system. Then, in your project directory, install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
Next, start the backend:
```
python backend.py
```
Finally, open the frontend script (frontend.html) in your favorite browser:
